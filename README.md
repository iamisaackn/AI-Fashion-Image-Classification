# AI-Couture-Elevating-Fashion-Through-Image-Classification
The project leverages the Fashion-MNIST dataset, normalizes images, and applies data augmentation. Advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with hyperparameter tuning are implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is deployed via a Streamlit app, containerized using Docker.
